/*  Working of the sensor

The soil moisture sensor consists of two probes which are used to measure the volumetric content of water. The two probes allow the current
to pass through the soil and then it gets the resistance value to measure the moisture value.
When there is more water, the soil will conduct more electricity which means that there will be less resistance. Therefore, the moisture 
level will be higher. Dry soil conducts electricity poorly, so when there will be less water, then the soil will conduct less electricity
which means that there will be more resistance. Therefore, the moisture level will be lower

Mapping of sensor values
To connect the sensor in the analog mode, we will need to use the analog output of the sensor. When taking the analog output from thesoil
moisture sensor FC-28, the sensor gives us the value from 0-1023. The moisture is measured in percentage, so we will map these values 
from 0 -100 and then we will show these values on the serial monitor.You can further set different ranges of the moisture values and 
turn on or off the water pump according to it

we will map the output values to 0-100, because the moisture is measured in percentage. When we took the readings from the dry soil, 
then the sensor value was 550 and in the wet soil, the sensor value was 10. So, we mapped these values to get the moisture.
