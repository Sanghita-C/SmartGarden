void setup() {
     pinMode(9, OUTPUT);
     pinMode(2, INPUT);
     pinMode(3, INPUT);
}

void loop() {
if(digitalRead(2)==HIGH)
{
     digitalWrite(9,HIGH);
     delay(1000);
}
else if(digitalRead(3)==HIGH)
{
     digitalWrite(9,LOW);
     delay(1000);
}
}

Firstly we have defined digital pin 9 as output for the solenoid and digital pin 2 and 3 as input pins for buttons.
Now in void loop, turn on or off the solenoid based on status of digital pin 2 and 3, where two push buttons are connected to turn on and
off the solenoid

When button 1 is pressed, Arduino send a HIGH logic to gate terminal of the MOSFET IRF540, connected on the 9th pin of the Arduino.
As IRF540 is an N-Channel MOSFET, so when its gate terminal gets HIGH, it allow the flow of current from drain to source and turn the 
solenoid on.

Similarly, when we press the button 2, Arduino sends a LOW logic to the gate terminal of the MOSFET IRF540 which makes the solenoid turn
off.
